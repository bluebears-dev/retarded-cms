# Retarded CMS
A CMS built upon Laravel, Vue.js and Pusher.

## Features
* User management module (Role editing, adding new users, removing exsiting ones)
* Page management module (Markdown content editing + subpage management)
* Menu management module (Simple menu entry editing)
* Chat (Real-time public chat between users)
* Theme management (Very simple theme chooser with "availability" to add new ones)

## Instalation
Download source code. Upload it to your server with your .env files (according to your server, database, pusher etc).

For developement usage just simply download whole source code, edit .env files and use ''docker-compose'' to set it up.

## Why?
I've created this CMS mostly as a proof of concept I can code one, but also for web developement classes on my university. 
It is very simple. It lacks lots of features (like components to bulild a page, file-based theme manager, easy setup etc).
